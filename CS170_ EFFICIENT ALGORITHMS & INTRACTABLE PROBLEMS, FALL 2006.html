<b>Clarification regarding problem 10.3:</b> The problem asks you to compute <br>
Fourier transform "Modulo M". Please note that this is NOT like <br>
problem 2.30 where we computed Fourier transform in a finite <br>
field. For problem 10.3, you are supposed to compute the usual (using <br>
complex roots of unity) Fourier transform. In this context "Mod M" <br>
only means the basis states (of which the QFT is a superposition) are <br>
|0&gt;, |1&gt;, ..., |M-1&gt;. <br><br>

The review session will be held on Monday (12/11) from 5:30 - 7:00 pm
in 310, Soda Hall.<br><br>

Problem 10.2 for HW14 is cancelled. For problem 10.3, refer to the first
two paragraphs in section 10.3<br><br>

The final exam is going to be held on Thursday, December 14,
12.30-3.30 pm, in 10 Evans. A review session will be held on Monday,
time and location TBD.<br><br>


Problem 8.13(e) for HW-13 has been made optional<br><br>

Problems 9.2, 9.3 added to HW-13. An additional hint for problem 8.13
has also been added. <br><br>

A list with all grades recorded so far has been uploaded to <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs170/fa06/weblist.htm"> this page</a>.
The leftmost column contains the sudent's SID number, mod 164617. 
<h3>HOMEWORKS</h3>
All homeworks are due <b>Friday at 4:00pm</b> unless otherwise stated.
Turn in your homeworks in the box labeled "CS170" on the 2nd
floor of Soda Hall.  <i>Please begin your answer to each problem on a new
sheet of paper.</i>  Please ensure that each sheet is
labeled with your name, SID number, <i>section number</i>, and "CS170--Fall 2006".
<i> You risk receiving no credit for any homework submitted without
this information.</i> 
Please take the time to write clear and concise solutions; we will
not grade messy or unreadable submissions.
The lowest two homework scores will be dropped.
No late homeworks will be accepted.
<br>
<ul> 

<li>
<b> Homework 1 </b> Problems 0.1, 0.4; 1.4, 1.5 from the book. <b>Due

<b> Homework 2 </b> Problems 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.26, 1.34, 1.39 from the book. 
And the following problem:<br>[<b>This problem has been postponed to next week</b>:]
You wish to pick a random 100 digit prime number.
You pick a 100 digit number at random, use a probabilistic test for primality
and output if the algorithm says prime. Let's analyze
this algorithm:
<br>
a) Roughly how many 100 digit numbers are prime.
A rough estimate,
within say 1%, is acceptable for this and the subsequent parts of this question. 
<br>
b) Suppose your primality test gives the wrong answer with
probability 1/1000. What is the chance that your algorithm
mistakenly outputs a composite instead of a prime? 
<br>
c) Suppose you want the chance of erroneously outputing a
composite to be less than one in a thousand. How small
should the error probability on your primality test be?

x3 &gt;=200.<br>
Solve the new LP, and show your work in the same detail as Figure
7.13. Since (0,0,0) is no longer feasible, you must start by finding a
corner, as described in Section 7.6.3. <br>

<h3>EXAMS</h3>
There will be two midterms and one final.  Dates and other details
will be announced in due course.<br><br>

<h3>QUIZZES</h3>
There will be a short quiz at the beginning of class on randomly selected
dates.  The quiz will consist of a small number of very simple questions
related to the material of the previous class.  The two lowest quiz scores
will be dropped.  The motivation for the 
quizzes is twofold: (1) to encourage you to review the material of each
class before the next class; (2) to encourage on-time arrival at lectures.<br><br>

<h3>ASSESSMENT</h3>

Your grade in the class will be determined as follows:
Homeworks 25%; Midterms 20% each; Final 30%; Quizzes 5%.
<br><br>

<h3>COURSE POLICIES</h3>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Formal prerequisites are CS61B and either CS70 or Math55.  
In particular, you should be comfortable with mathematical induction, 
big-O notation, basic data structures and binary heaps.  If you need to refresh
any of this background, you should refer to the relevant portions of the book. 
It is also assumed that you have experience with programming in a standard imperative
language such as C, C++ or Java.  Although most homeworks will be pencil-and-paper
exercises, you may also be expected to do some small programming assignments.
<br><br>

<!--
<b>Readings:</b> Lecture notes will be posted on this web page on or before
the day of the relevant class; most of these notes are draft chapters of
a book in preparation by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou and Umesh Vazirani.
For additional background and examples, it is recommended that students consult the book 
<i><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8569">
Introduction to Algorithms</a></i>, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein,
Second Edition, MIT Press, 2001 (which we shall refer to as CLRS).  
Pointers to the relevant sections of this book will also be provided as we go along.

<b>Contact Information:</b> The instructor and TAs will post announcements, 
clarifications, hints, etc. to this website and/or to the class newsgroup,
<a href="news:ucb.class.cs170">ucb.class.cs170</a>.
Hence you must check this website and the newsgroup frequently throughout the
semester.  For information on how to access UCB newsgroups, go 
<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/connecting.html#news">here</a> 
(see also <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/usr/pub/news.help">here</a> 
for more).

<p>If you have a question, your best option is to post a message to the 
newsgroup.  The staff (instructor and TAs) will check the newsgroup regularly, 
and if you use the newsgroup, other students will be able to help you too.
When using the newsgroup, please avoid off-topic discussions, and
please do not post answers to homework questions before the homework
is due.

</p><p>If your question is personal or not of interest to other students,
you may send email to cs170@cory.eecs.  Email to this address is
forwarded to the instructor and all TAs.  We prefer that you use this
address, rather than directly emailing the instructor and/or your TA.
If you wish to talk with one of us individually, you are welcome to
come to our office hours.  If the office hours are not convenient, you
may make an appointment with any of us by email.  Please reserve email 
for the questions you can't get answered in office hours, in discussion 
sections, or through the newsgroup.

</p><p>In a class this large, it can be challenging for the instructor to
gauge how smoothly the class is going.  We always welcome any feedback
on what we could be doing better.  If you would like to send anonymous
comments or criticisms, please feel free to use an anonymous remailer
like <a href="http://www.gilc.org/speech/anonymous/remailer.html">this
one</a> to avoid revealing your identity.

<br><br>

<b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work on homework problems in study 
groups of two to four people; however, you <b>must</b> write up the solutions 
on your own, and you must <b>never</b> read or copy the solutions of other students.
Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, 
but you <b>must</b> credit all such sources in your writeup and you must
<b>never</b> copy material verbatim.


<b>Warning:</b> Your attention is drawn to the Department's 
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/acad.dis.shtml"> 
Policy on Academic Dishonesty</a>.
In particular, you should be aware that
copying solutions, in whole or in part, from other
students in the class <i>or any other source</i> without acknowledgment
constitutes cheating.  Any student found to be cheating risks automatically
failing the class and being referred to the Office of Student Conduct.
<br><br>

<b>Regrading Policies:</b> 
Regrading of homeworks or exams will only be undertaken in cases where
you believe there has been a genuine error or misunderstanding.
Bear in mind that our primary aim in grading is consistency, so that
all students are treated the same; for this reason, we will not adjust 
the score of one student on an issue of partial credit unless the score 
allocated clearly deviates from the grading policy we adopted for that 
problem.  If you wish to request a regrading of a homework or exam, you 
must return it to your section TA with a written note on a separate piece
of paper explaining the problem.  The entire assignment may be regraded, 
so be sure to check the solutions to confirm that your overall score will 
go up after regrading.  All such requests must be received within one
week from the date on which the homework or exam was made available for
return.


<br><br>  
</p><h3>SOME HELPFUL HINTS</h3>

The following tips are offered based on our experience with Upper Division 
classes in CS Theory.  If you follow these guidelines, you will make life 
much easier for yourself in this class.

<p><b>1. Don't fall behind!</b>  In a conceptual class such as this, it is
particularly important to maintain a steady effort throughout the semester,
rather than hope to cram just before homework deadlines or exams.
This is because it takes time and practice for the ideas to sink in.
Make sure you allocate a sufficient number of hours every week to the
class, including enough time for reading and understanding the material
as well as for doing assignments.  (As a rough guide, you should expect to
do at least one hour of reading and two hours of problem solving for each
hour of lecture.)  Even though this class does not have
any major projects, you should plan to spend as much time on it as on
any of your other Upper Division technical classes.

</p><p><b>2. Take the homeworks seriously!</b>  The homeworks are explicitly designed
to help you to learn the material as you go along.  Although the numerical weight 
of the homeworks is not huge, there is usually a strong correlation between homework 
scores and final grades in the class.  Also, regardless of how well you did on
the homework, <i>read the sample solutions</i>, even for the problems you got
right.  You may well learn a different way of looking at the problem, and you
may also benefit from emulating the style of the solutions.
(In science people learn a lot from emulating the approach of more
experienced scientists.)

</p><p><b>3. Make use of office hours!</b>  The instructor and TAs hold office hours
expressly to help you.  It is often surprising how many students do not take 
advantage of this service.  You are free to attend as many office hours as you 
wish (you are not constrained just to use the office hours of your section
TA).  You will also likely get more out of an office hour if you have spent a 
little time in advance thinking about the questions you have, and formulating
them precisely.  (In fact, this process can often lead you to a solution yourself!)

</p><p><b>4. Take part in discussion sections!</b>  Discussion sections are <b>not</b>

auxiliary lectures.  They are an opportunity for interactive learning, through
guided group problem solving and other activities.  The success of a discussion
section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it.
As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more
you are likely to get out of it.

</p><p><b>5. Form study groups!</b>  As stated above, you are encouraged to form
small groups (two to four people) to work together on homeworks and on understanding
the class material on a regular basis.  In addition to being fun, this can save you 
a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up 
on some point or other.  Of course, it is your responsibility to
ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely
not help you much.  And recall the caveat above that you <b>must</b> write up
your solutions  on your own.
